    fullReview: "I still can't believe it. I passed the NCLEX in just 85 questions, and I truly couldn't have done it without the NCLEX Bootcamp. As a full-time bedside nurse, studying while working felt overwhelming at times. But NCLEX Bootcamp gave me structure, support, and a clear path forward. The Cheat Sheets were not just informative, they were empowering. They explained everything in a way that made even the toughest topics feel manageable. I started to feel less anxious and more confident every day. The strategies, drills, and cheat sheets were exactly what I needed. Thank you, Bootcamp, for helping me believe in myself and for helping me become a U.S. RN in just 85 questions. If you're preparing for the NCLEX, I can honestly say Bootcamp is one of the best decisions you can make.",

    fullReview: "Bootcamp was awesome! I initially started using the free trial and committed to the 3-month membership after finding the rationales, questions, and interface so helpful and easy to use (and the best I'd seen in comparison to other prep courses). Bootcamp tells you why wrong answers are wrong in addition to the rationale for the correct answer. YES! The images and charts were great for making complex topics easier to access and organize in my brain. I followed the study plan calendar and passed my exam in 85 questions. Would 10/10 recommend Bootcamp!",

Their videos made so much sense and really help emphasize the important thing that helped me pass my exams. Bootcamp was also much cheaper and affordable than other third party resources that I considered. I just wish I found it sooner!",
